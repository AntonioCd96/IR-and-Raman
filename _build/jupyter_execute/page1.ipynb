    "Adsorption is a surface–based exothermic process that leads to the transfer of a molecule from a fluid bulk to the solid surface of the adsorbent. The substance that is adsorbed to the adsorbent is called adsorbate. The process may also be classified as physical adsorption (physisorption) or chemical sorption (chemisorption), depending on the interactions between the molecules and surface. Physical adsorption is dominated by weak Van der Waals forces and electrostatic interactions, while in chemisorption, strong chemical bonds such as covalent bonds are formed between the surface and the adsorbed species. Chemical adsorption is slow-paced compared to physical adsorption and most frequently a monomolecular layer is formed on the material surface. In contrast, physisorption usually entails the formation of a thick multilayer on the surface [1] \n",
